# GPTBot
GPTBot is a Discord.py script to leverage the OpenAI ChatGPT API to power a Discord Bot to answer questions without having to leave discord. This was originally intended to be placed as a study guide helper, but there is potential for far more thanks to the power of the Google Bartd API.

Please note, this code does not include any API keys for ChatGPT or Discord. These would need to be created separately.

# Changelog
As this is an alpha version, I will attempt to update this with each new update until this is a working project. As issues are resolved, the code will be updated with new 0.0.# version numbers. Once the script runs, the working version number will change to 1.0.## with the ## being the alpha build number. Version numbers will be formatted as Major Version . Feature Update . Run Number.

Version 0.0.1 - Posted code is able to connect to ChatGPT but is currently unable to be tested. In order for the API to work, a paid subscription to OpenAI's Chat GPT is required. At this time, project is on hold until further testing is able to be completed.
